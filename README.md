# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The main motivation around the Prework Study Guide Webpage is use it as a virtual recollcation of my notes during the prework in addition to updating it throughout the contents of the course. This project will help keep everything I have learned "under one roof" in a neat organized fashion so I won't have to keep flipping through pages of handwritten notes. The main problem it will solve is organization, since I won't have to continue going through poorly written notes in a journal. Additionally, I can share it with my peers to compare what other items they think are pertinent throughout this course. I have already learned so much in this course prework so far from HTML, CSS, Git/GitHub, and JavaScript. I have already learned a lot in using the CLI/GitBash, setting up SSH Keys, and creating GitHub repositories and updating with current issues to be worked on. I have also gotten experience in working with completing the Git Flow once changes are made and commiting them to our main repo. Lastly, I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create everything in this webpage from the layout, styling, and interactiveness.
