          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, descriptioon, keywords, author, and viewport</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists</li>

        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and 
            the value of the property. For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS 
            property color and the value for that property, blue</li>
          <li>Inline CSS and internal style sheets are totally acceptable methods under certain 
            conditions, but the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.</li>

          <li>Boolean Variables: 
            This is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks. EX- let myVariable = true;</li>
